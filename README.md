## About

Hi! I am Sebastian Gomez-Duranona, and this is my blog SandhillScapegoat. I am a Computer Science student based in Omaha, Nebraska. Throughout my student and professional career, I have been able to work with several companies in the space of Fraud Prevention, Identity Verification, and Trust and Safety. These experiences, as well as growing up in the World of Information, have planted a seed of curiosity and discomfort in the way digital identity is managed today. I firmly believe that it is imperative for all of us who share a space in this interconnected world to think hard about our identities inside and outside the online world. This is why I decided to launch SandhillScapegoat, an online persona and blog that will allow me to explore these topics in order to (hopefully) bring more clarity into the online landscape.
